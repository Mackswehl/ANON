#Description

Our project is an interactive casino, one where the user can choose from a wide variety of casino games. A person will be 
able to spend money to play various casino games, such as Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Keno, Craps, and Baccarat. Many of the 
games will have a brief description of their rules and how to win the game. Depending on their skill or luck, they can lose 
or gain money, based on the game and how the player can win at the game they play. There are several game types included in 
the casino. Some are card based that require the player to deal with a deck of cards while they play. Other games will not 
and instead rely on other means to play the game, such as the slot machine and Roulette. The player can switch between the 
games after winning or losing them, and can choose to withdraw their earnings between each game to leave the casino with 
their current amount of money. Of course, the money isn’t just going to go to waste once the player is done making big bank 
in The HawDog Casino…. No of course not. Instead, once the player is satisfied with their winnings, they may visit The 
HawDog Shoppe in which they may cash in their chips and cash in exchange for exclusive digital trinkets and prizes. 

#Instructions

1. In order to run and play in the casino, one must first launch the driver class Casino. By executing the file, one will be 
able to start up the casino.

2. Upon launching the casino, the player will be prompted to either login to a pre-existing account or create a new account. If 
the player logs into an old account, they will be able to continue from their previous progress. Otherwise, the player can 
simply start anew with a brand new account. The player will need to enter a name and their age. If their age is 21 and over, 
they can begin their capitalist conquest. We here at the Hawdog Casino reward new members for living to the age of 21 by 
giving them $100 of casino money to start with.

3. After entering the casino, the player will have a broad selection of games that they can choose from. Each of these games 
will come with a set of instructions on what the game is and how to play it. By reading the game's rules and developing 
efficient strategies, the player is guaranteed success for each game, with a bit of luck of course.

4. Although there is no ultimate way to win this casino, the general goal is to win as much money as you can. Most 
importantly, the goal is to enjoy your time here at the Hawdog Casino. Enjoy!
